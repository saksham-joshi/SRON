## What is SRON?

SRON (Saksham Rapid Object Notation) is a high-level, open-sourced programming language developed by Saksham Joshi. 

Combining the ease of Python, the stability of Java, and the speed and efficiency of C++, SRON offers a unique blend of features: Static + Dynamic typing, Garbage Collector, Return Value Optimization, Runtime Variable Management, Highly secured Bytecode, Abundant functions and a lot more.

Designed to provide developers with a blazingly fast and versatile coding experience with well written and easy to grasp documentations.

## How SRON works?

The compiler converts source code into SRON's bytecode, which is then saved to a ".srb" file. Subsequently, the SRON interpreter executes the bytecode file efficiently, offering high speed, reduced memory usage, and lower power consumption.

## How SRON is developed?

SRON version 2.1 and before were developed in C++11 using GCC compiler and the next version 2.2 is developed in C++23 using Clang compiler. Both the compiler and interpreter feature a highly sophisticated architecture. The source code is available for free to review. Note that some parts of code is still hidden for security purposes.

The design and implementation of SRON took Saksham over a year to finalize, ensuring optimal performance and reliability. Detailed development logs documenting the entire journey of SRON's creation are available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/part-1-how-i-developed-sron-saksham-joshi-wqoac/), authored by Saksham Joshi.


The SRON's compiler converts the source code into a bytecode and saves it in a .srb file.
The main.srb file is further executed by SRON Interpreter.
