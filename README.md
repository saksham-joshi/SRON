## 🧩 What is SRON?

**SRON (Saksham Rapid Object Notation)** is a high-level, open-sourced programming language developed by **Saksham Joshi**.  

Combining the **ease of Python**, the **stability of Java**, and the **speed and efficiency of C++**, SRON offers a unique blend of features:
**Static + Dynamic typing**, **Garbage Collector**, **Return Value Optimization**, **Runtime Variable Management**, **Highly Secured Bytecode**, **Abundant Functions**, and much more.

It’s designed to deliver a **blazingly fast and versatile coding experience** — backed by **clear, well-structured documentation**.

## ⚙️ How SRON Works

The **compiler** converts source code into SRON’s **bytecode**, stored as a `.srb` file.  
The **interpreter** then executes this bytecode efficiently, achieving **high speed**, **reduced memory usage**, and **lower power consumption**.

## 🧠 How SRON is Developed

SRON **versions ≤ 2.1** were built in **C++11** using the **GCC compiler**, while **version 2.2 and above** are developed in **C++23** using **Clang**.  
Both the compiler and interpreter feature a **highly sophisticated architecture**.  
While most of the source code is public, some critical parts remain closed for **security reasons**.

The design and implementation took **over a year**, focusing on **performance and reliability**.  
Detailed development logs are available on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/part-1-how-i-developed-sron-saksham-joshi-wqoac/), authored by **Saksham Joshi**.

The compiler generates a **.srb bytecode** file, which the **SRON Interpreter** executes to run the program.
