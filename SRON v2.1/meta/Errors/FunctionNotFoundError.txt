> Reason 1 : Specified function not found or may be unaccessible.
    > Reason 2 : The Function Bytecode file is not in the same directory as the file.
    
    ||> Solution 1 : Make sure the function you are calling has same letter casing(uppercase, lowercase etc.) 
                     as the original function.
    ||> Solution 2 : Maybe you are mis-spelling the function name.
    ||> Solution 3 : Maybe the specified function is not actually a function but a variable. If this is the case,
                     then remove the brackets just after the function name.
    ||> Solution 4: Maybe you are trying to call a function without specifying round brackets after that.
