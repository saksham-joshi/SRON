> Reason : You are trying to convert a value to another type which is not possible.

	||> Solution 1 : If you are trying to convert a String to Int, then
                     make sure the string should contain only digits and
                     first character can be negative sign (-).

    ||> Solution 2 : If you are trying to convert a String to Double, then
                     make sure the string should contain only digits, only
                     one decimal point (.) and first character can be a 
                     negative sign (-).

    ||> Solution 3 : If you are trying to convert a value of type List to String
                     or List to Int which are not actually possible, then you 
                     have to check the type of the value before converting it.
                     You can use isBool, isInt, isDouble, isList etc. to check types.
