/*
  |====================== List ===============================|
 'List' datatype uses std::vector<Any*> to store values.
  > It is dynamic in size as well as in nature so it can store values of different datatype in a single entity. It can store List too but not itself.
  > Syntax in SRON : "List x = [1,123.678, true, false, "Heelo", 'Q' ]" or "List x" or "List x = []"
