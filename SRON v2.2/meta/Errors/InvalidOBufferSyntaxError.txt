> Reason 1 : You are trying to use the OBUFFER as a value like passing it as function call argument etc.
    > Reason 2 : You are trying to use it within Mathematical Block.
    > Reason 3 : You are trying to use invalid assignment operator with it.
    > Reason 4 : You are trying to call print/println like this:
                       print( OBUFFER )

    ||> Solution 1 : Know this, OBUFFER can only be used in the following ways:
                        OBUFFER += "Hello"
                        OBUFFER += 2706
                        OBUFFER += true
                        OBUFFER += 2706.2003
                        OBUFFER += [1, 2, 3]
                        OBUFFER += Void
                        OBUFFER += 'A'
                        OBUFFER += Foo()
                        OBUFFER += variable
                        OBUFFER += ~{ 2 + 7 }~

                        console : ( OBUFFER ) @ to flush/print the content of buffer
