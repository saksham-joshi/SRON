> Reason 1 : The function name is not a valid name(means the function should start from a 
             alphabet or underscore and should contain only alphabet, numbers and underscore.)
    > Reason 2 : Because SRON saves your function in a seperate file with filename as the function 
                 name, therefore there are some reserved filenames which you cannot put as function
                 name.

    ||> Solution 1 : Think of a valid function name and keep it less than 32 characters.
    ||> Solution 2 : Below is the list of reserved filename and avoid using them as your function name.

                   -> 'con'      -> 'prn'      -> 'aux'
                   -> 'nul'      -> 'com0'     -> 'com1'
                   -> 'com2'     -> 'com3'     -> 'com4'
                   -> 'com5'     -> 'com6'     -> 'com7'
                   -> 'com8'     -> 'com9'     -> 'lpt0'
                   -> 'lpt1'     -> 'lpt2'     -> 'lpt3'
