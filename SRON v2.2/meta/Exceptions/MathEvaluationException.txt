> Reason 1 : You are trying to evaluate invalid mathematical expression.
    > Reason 2 : You have passed invalid operators between values.
    > Reason 3 : If you are using the assignment operator(=) inside the mathematical block,
                 then this error will rise.

    ||> Solution 1 : To solve an expression, only +, -, *, /, %,^, ||, &&, !, >, <, <=, >=  
                     xor, lsft, rsft, and, not, or, != operators are allowed.
    ||> Solution 2 : Use valid operators for solving the expressions.
