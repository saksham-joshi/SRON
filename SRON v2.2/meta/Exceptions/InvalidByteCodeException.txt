> Reason 1 : Maybe you made some changes in the bytecode.
    > Reason 2 : Maybe the version of the SRON's compiler is not as same as the compiler 
                 by which the bytecode is generated.
    > Reason 3 : Maybe this is a bug of SRON.
    > Reason 4 : This problem also arise when the version of the bytecode doesn't
                 matches with the version of interpreter.
    > Reason 5 : If you renamed the bytecode file, then also this problem arises.
    > Reason 6 : You are trying to call a function whose bytecode is invalid.
