> Reason 1 : You have not declared arguments of the function in a proper syntax.
    > Reason 2 : Maybe you have assigned values to the arguments.
    > Reason 3 : Maybe you have specified an non-existing invalid datatype.
    > Reason 4 : Maybe you have declared an invalid identifier.

    ||> Solution 1 : Don't assign values to the arguments.
    ||> Solution 2 : You can only declare these datatypes: Int, Double, Char, Bool, String and List.
    ||> Solution 3 : The name of the argument must be valid(starting with a alphabet or underscore, 
                     without any special character and length of less than 32).
