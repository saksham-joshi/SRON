    ||> Solution 1 : Make sure the function you are calling has same letter casing(uppercase, lowercase etc.) as 
                     the original function.
    ||> Solution 2 : Maybe you are mis-spelling the function name.
    ||> Solution 3 : Maybe the specified function is not actually a function but a variable. If this is the case, 
                     then remove the brackets just after the function name.
