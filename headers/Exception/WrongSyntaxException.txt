> Reason 1 : You are not following the rules of programming in SRON.
    > Reason 2 : Maybe you have given Instructions in a wrong syntax.
    > Reason 3 : If you are trying to write two attributes within a single line, it will generate this error.
    > Reason 4 : Maybe you left an empty attribute or instruction. This may also raised this error.
    > Reason 5 : Maybe you have created a empty functions with no pairs of attribute and instructions.
    > Reason 6 : If you are creating an scope after an attribute, then attributes can only be if, elif, else, for and while.

    ||> Solution 1 : Read the official documentation of SRON.
    ||> Solution 2 : Follow the rules and keep learning SRON.
    ||> Solution 3 : Write statements in this way-  Attribute : Instructions
